is wgs84.  simply accessing the url will download the geojson with the locations of traffic loops currently in use. if you would prefer the data in nad83 utm zone 10 instead you could make the request like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://gis.surrey.ca:8080/fmedatastreaming/trafficloopcount/trafficloops.fmw?proj_epsg=26910\r\n\r\nlane_direction indicates the heading of the traffic (nb, sb, eb, wb). \r\n\r\nintersection_id corresponds to the intid field in the intersections dataset which can be found on the surrey open data site. \r\n\r\nroad_facilityid indicates which road segment the loop is located on. this corresponds to the facilityid in the road centrelines dataset on the city of surrey open data site.\r\n\r\n**traffic loop counts** web service provides the counts for each traffic loop in 15 minute intervals. while the data is broken down by 15 minute intervals it is currently only updated once per day. we are currently working on increasing the frequency of updates in order to allow for real time traffic applications.  the loop_id and datetime combinations are unique in the output.\r\n\r\nthe service accepts 2 optional parameters *startdatetime* and *enddatetime* which are used to specify the time and date range of interest. these follow the [iso 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iso_8601 \"iso 8601\") standard.  for example march 24 2016 at 1:00 pm pacific standard time would be 2016-03-24t13:00:00-08.  the output timestamp will contain the time zone offset, either -08 (pst) or -07 (pdt) depending on whether daylight savings time was observed at the output datetime.  in order to work with local time you may omit the time zone offset from the input and truncate it from the output.\r\n\r\nto request all the data from beginning of march 22 until the end of
